<p><strong>Materia medica</strong>, a term rooted in Latin, translates to “medical material” or “substance.” The historical use of medicinal substances dates back to ancient civilizations.</p>
<p>Around 1000 B.C., ancient Egyptian medicine already employed various herbs like garlic, opium, castor oil, coriander, mint, and indigo for medicinal purposes. This indicates an early recognition of the healing properties of plants and other natural materials.</p>
<p>One of the earliest comprehensive compilations of medicinal substances is found in the <strong>Sushruta Samhita</strong>, an Indian Ayurvedic treatise from the 6th century B.C. This text detailed 700 medicinal plants, 64 mineral-based preparations, and 57 animal-based preparations, reflecting a rich tradition of herbal knowledge.</p>
<p>In Chinese medicine, the Shennong Emperor’s Classic of Materia Medica, dating back to the 1st century AD, stands out. This manual lists around 365 medicines, with 252 of them derived from herbs, showcasing the Chinese understanding of the therapeutic potential of various plant-based substances.</p>
<p>The Greek physician Dioscorides made a significant contribution with his work “<strong>De Materia Medica</strong>” in the first century AD, becoming the first European treatise on the properties and uses of medicinal plants. With descriptions of over 500 plants, this compilation remained an authoritative reference for centuries.</p>
<p>In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and physicians expanded on this knowledge. For instance, in the 9th century, al-Dinawari documented over 637 plant-based drugs, contributing to the growing wealth of information on materia medica.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="traditional-medicine"><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Traditional Medicine</h2>
<p>Traditional medicine, at its core, is a fusion of philosophy and medicine, drawing on ancient wisdom and practices. One prominent example is <strong>Ayurvedic medicine</strong>, a system native to India that intertwines philosophy and the science of life.</p>
<p>The term “Ayurveda” stems from the Sanskrit words “āyus,” meaning ‘life,’ and “veda,” meaning ‘science.’ This holistic approach is grounded in the belief in the existence of five fundamental elements—earth, water, fire, air, and space—that form not only the universe but also the human body.</p>
<p>According to Ayurveda, the human body comprises seven primary constituent elements: blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, chyle, and semen. Each of these elements plays a vital role in the functioning of the body, reflecting a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of life.</p>
<p>Central to Ayurvedic philosophy is the emphasis on balance among three fundamental substances: wind or spirit (representing air), phlegm, and bile. These are seen as divine forces governing different aspects of life. Maintaining equilibrium among these forces is believed to contribute to overall health and well-being.</p>
<p>In essence, Ayurvedic medicine reflects a profound understanding of the elements shaping the universe and the human body. Its philosophy intertwines seamlessly with medicinal practices, emphasizing the importance of balance and harmony in the divine forces governing life. This holistic approach has endured through the ages, offering a unique perspective on health and healing.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)</strong> represents a sophisticated integration of philosophy and medical theory, encompassing intricate concepts such as Yin-yang, the Five Phases, the human body Channel, Zang Fu organ theory, and Qi.</p>
<p>In TCM, the theory is rich and complex, with each herb assigned specific characteristics. Herbs are classified based on temperature, ranging from extreme yin (cold) to extreme yang (hot), and they are further categorized by taste—pungent, sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. This classification forms the basis for understanding the herb’s therapeutic properties and how it interacts with the body.</p>
<p>The core principle of TCM herbal treatment is to restore the internal balance of Yin and Yang within the patient. Yin and Yang represent opposing forces that, when in harmony, contribute to a person’s well-being. The goal of herbal treatment is to rebalance these forces, addressing the root cause of health issues.</p>
<p>What makes TCM particularly unique is its approach to individualized medicine. Each prescription is essentially a carefully crafted cocktail of multiple herbs, each serving a distinct purpose. This tailoring allows practitioners to create personalized treatments, acknowledging the individual patient’s unique constitution and health needs.</p>
<p>In summary, Traditional Chinese Medicine offers a comprehensive approach to health, intertwining philosophy and intricate medical theories. The emphasis on balance, personalized prescriptions, and the integration of diverse concepts makes TCM a distinctive and holistic system that has been practiced and refined over centuries.</p>

<h3 data-number="12.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="history-of-using-plants-as-medicines"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.1</span> History of Using Plants as Medicines</h3>
<p>From the 1800s to the present day, the pursuit of active compounds from plants has undergone significant changes and evolutions.</p>
<p>In the earlier centuries, there was a prevailing focus on the concept of “one molecule, one medicine.” Scientists sought to identify individual molecules within plants that could serve as effective medicines against various diseases. This reductionist approach aimed at isolating specific compounds for medicinal purposes.</p>
<p>As research advanced, a multitude of active compounds were successfully identified, each showing potential in addressing different health conditions. This marked a crucial phase in understanding the diverse therapeutic properties hidden within plants.</p>
<p>To ensure a sustainable supply of these plant-derived active compounds, scientists employed multiple approaches. These included methods for cultivating and harvesting plants, as well as developing techniques for extracting and synthesizing the desired molecules.</p>
<p>However, during a certain period, there was a shift in focus. Formulated medicine, which involves combining multiple compounds or herbs, was somewhat overlooked, with many active compounds being marketed and consumed as individual supplements rather than as part of a holistic medicine approach.</p>
<p>In recent times, there has been a renewed interest in formulated medicine. Researchers and practitioners are revisiting the concept of combining multiple compounds in specific formulations, acknowledging the potential synergies that can arise. This renewed interest suggests a shift back towards recognizing the value of traditional philosophies that considered the holistic nature of plant-based medicines.</p>
<p>In summary, the journey from the 1800s to the present in the quest for active compounds has seen shifts in focus, from isolating individual molecules to acknowledging the potential synergies in formulated medicines. The current resurgence of interest in formulated medicine reflects a recognition of the holistic approaches embedded in traditional philosophies and the importance of considering the complex interactions among various plant compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Artemisinin</strong>, a significant terpenoid, was originally extracted from the Chinese medicinal herb Artemisia annua, which had been used for over a millennium to treat skin diseases and malaria.</p>
<p>Today, artemisinin is a vital drug employed in the treatment of multi-drug resistant strains of Falciparum malaria, a particularly challenging form of the disease. One notable aspect is its rapid turnover time, which may contribute to the parasite’s struggle to develop resistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a switch to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) for malaria treatment.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of artemisinin against malaria is fascinating. During a malaria infection, hemoglobin is consumed, releasing free heme—an iron-porphyrin complex. Artemisinin interacts with this free heme, creating high-valent iron-oxo species. This sets off a chain reaction, producing reactive oxygen radicals that inflict damage upon the parasite, ultimately leading to its demise.</p>
<p>Artemisinin production is primarily sourced from plantations, with ongoing efforts in breeding to enhance productivity. While chemical synthesis is feasible, it remains costly. Genetic Modification (GM) presents a promising avenue to increase artemisinin production, and breakthroughs include the use of yeast to produce artemisinic acid, a precursor to artemisinin, through synthetic biology.</p>
<p>The Bill Gates Foundation is actively supporting research aimed at large-scale production of artemisinin, with the goal of making it more accessible to developing countries. This highlights the global efforts to combat malaria and underscores the importance of innovative approaches, including genetic modification and synthetic biology, in addressing health challenges on a broader scale.</p>

<p>The discovery of artemisinin is a fascinating story that unfolded during the Vietnam War (1955-75). In 1969, the Chinese army initiated Project 523 to address the severe problem of malaria. The breakthrough came in 1972 when Tu Youyou’s research group identified artemisinin in the leaves of Artemisia annua, a medicinal herb. The drug derived from artemisinin was named Qinghaosu in Chinese.</p>
<p>Remarkably, artemisinin was just one among nearly 5000 traditional Chinese medicines. When tested against 2000 formulated medicines, it didn’t initially stand out. However, a literature review revealed that the traditional preparation of artemisinin, without heating, as documented in Ge Hong’s “Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One’s Sleeve,” was a crucial detail. Further experimentation determined that solvent extraction was the most effective method.</p>
<p>This medicine played a pivotal role in the outcome of the Vietnam War, yet its significance remained relatively unknown outside of China until the 1980s. The discovery of artemisinin not only marked a turning point in the fight against malaria but also highlighted the potential treasures hidden within traditional herbal remedies. Tu Youyou’s dedication and the innovative approach to exploring ancient texts demonstrate the valuable intersection of traditional knowledge and modern scientific discovery.</p>

<h3 data-number="12.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paclitaxel"><span class="header-section-number">12.1.3</span> Paclitaxel</h3>
<p>Paclitaxel, a potent anti-cancer drug, originates from the terpenoids found in the bark of the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia). Discovered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1967, it is commercially known as ‘taxol’ or ‘abraxane’ and has been instrumental in treating various cancers, including lung, ovarian, breast, and head cancers. Its annual sales peaked at an impressive US$1.6 billion in 2000.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action of paclitaxel is intriguing—it binds to microtubules, preventing their breakdown and thereby halting cell division. This unique property makes it a valuable asset in the fight against cancer.</p>
<p>However, controversies surround paclitaxel, including ecological concerns due to the large demand for raw materials. Additionally, debates arise from academic research and commercial rights, with Bristol-Myers Squibb facing accusations of maintaining a ‘cancer monopoly.’ The generic name versus the commercial trademark also contributes to the discourse.</p>
<p>Over the years, the production of paclitaxel has undergone transformations. Initially sourced solely from the bark of the Pacific yew from 1967 to 1993, it later expanded to include needles of the tree and other Taxus species. A semisynthetic pathway, utilizing 10-deacetylbaccatin isolated from the European Yew’s needles, became an alternative. Presently, plant cell fermentation (PCF) is a common method for Taxol production, with PhytoBiotech being a major player. Looking ahead, there are prospects for paclitaxel production from fungi or even <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>) through metabolic engineering—an exciting frontier in cancer drug development.</p>

<p><strong>Psoriasis</strong>, a skin disorder characterized by inflammatory patches covered in silvery-white scales, particularly the common plaque psoriasis, is known for its immune-mediated nature. This condition triggers an accelerated growth of skin cells, with new cells maturing in just 3 to 6 days instead of the usual 28 to 30 days.</p>
<p>One of the treatments employed for psoriasis is PUVA (Psoralen plus Ultraviolet A) therapy. PUVA involves the use of Methoxypsoralen, a photosensitizing medication, in combination with ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation. The treatment induces inflammation and redness in the skin. Interestingly, this deliberate damage hinders the proliferation of skin cells, effectively reducing the formation of psoriasis plaques.</p>

<h3 data-number="12.3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-regulation"><span class="header-section-number">12.3.2</span> Importance of Regulation</h3>
<p>The importance of quality control (QC) for medical herbs cannot be overstated, considering the various factors that can significantly impact the composition and efficacy of herbal products. Genetic variation within plant species can lead to differences in the presence and concentration of bioactive compounds. An illustrative example is Stephania tetrandra, where only a specific variant among more than ten may contain the desired compound tetrandrine. This underscores the need for precise identification and selection of plant sources to ensure consistency in herbal formulations.</p>
<p>Misidentification of herbs poses a serious risk to consumers. An infamous case involved Aristolochia fangchi, which contains aristolochic acid, a nephrotoxic compound. The inadvertent use of this herb, instead of the intended Stephania tetrandra, resulted in severe kidney failure in some cases. This highlights the critical role of accurate plant identification in preventing harmful consequences.</p>
<p>The complexity of nomenclature in traditional medicine further complicates matters. Chinese medical herbs, for instance, may have one name referring to several species, as seen with GuanZhong, which encompasses 31 different species. Additionally, a single species might be referred to by different names, exemplified by TianQi. This linguistic variability emphasizes the necessity for standardized and precise botanical taxonomy to avoid confusion in the formulation and prescription of herbal medicines.</p>
<p>Adulteration, the intentional or unintentional inclusion of incorrect or inferior substances, is another challenge in the herbal industry. Rigorous QC practices, including authentication of raw materials and regular testing, are crucial for detecting and preventing adulteration. Companies that prioritize and implement robust QC measures not only safeguard consumer health but also position themselves favorably in the market by establishing trust and reliability.</p>
